<p>I'm that special little snowflake my grandfather always told me I was. I believed him and everything he aspired me to become. Currently I'm 21 years old trying to forge my way ahead into this big big world. I've had a passion for photography and the arts since I was little, and in High School my first job was a studio production assistant at a photography studio and continued on to be a wedding photographer for another company in my college years. I've recently graduated college with a Bachelors in Business Administration. A month after college I got my first "real" job. You know, with the official paycheck and all, and still take photos on the weekends. Life is never easy, and each day brings new challenges and new things to look forward to. I can't wait to share what those are with you!</p>
